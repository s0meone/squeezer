WORK IN PROGRESS
----------------
This project is in it's early stages, it is not finished by any means.
**Feel free to comment with help or criticism!**

It also lacks proper error handling and documentation.
Most of the critical refactor points have been marked with a 'todo' comment.

- active record like search methods and model relations (database, chained search engine?)
- playlist handling
- add convenience methods
- add some more sugar
